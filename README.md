# MH3U-WiiU-Patches

For EU game version.

# Usage / Installation

Use only one patch.

For Cemu emulator:

Locate your game's update data (referred to as v32 or 1.02). This should be in an extracted format, with 'code', 'content' and 'meta' folders.

Within 'code', locate 'MH3G_Cafe_EU.rpx'. Using [xdelta UI](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/), select the desired patch and MH3G_Cafe_EU.rpx, give the output file a temporary name, and place it in the code folder. Rename MH3G_Cafe_EU.rpx to MH3G_Cafe_EU.rpx.bkp (any name works, this is just a backup). Then, rename the output file you gave a temporary name to to MH3G_Cafe_EU.rpx.

Finally, in the Cemu emulator, install (say yes if asked to reinstall) the update data under File -> Install game title, update or DLC.

If patching fails, please verify MH3G_Cafe_EU.rpx matches the following MD5 hash: 382289663eb3bf8a73884260690449d
